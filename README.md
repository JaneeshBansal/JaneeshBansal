### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a first-year Biological Sciences PhD Student studying at Queen Mary University of London. 

My project is on using Bayesian Inference and Deep Learning approaches to infer patterns of disease spread from the genomes of the malaria parasite. I am currently working on distinguishing between population bottleneck and substructure scenarios using ABC.
