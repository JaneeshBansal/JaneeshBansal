### Hi there i'm Janeesh 👋

I am a second-year Biological Sciences PhD Student studying at Queen Mary University of London supervised by [Prof Richard Nichols](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbbs/staff/richardnichols.html), [Dr Matteo Fumagalli](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbbs/staff/matteo-fumagalli.html), [Dr Bob Verity](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/r.verity) and [Prof Alexander Gnedin](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/maths/profiles/gnedina.html). 

- 📌 My overall project is on using Bayesian Inference and Deep Learning approaches to infer patterns of disease spread from the genomes of the malaria parasite. 
- 🔭 I am currently working on distinguishing between population bottleneck and substructure scenarios using ABC and investigating demographic inference software tools.
